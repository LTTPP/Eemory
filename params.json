This is heavy and boring, so Eemory was born, which bring the benefits offered by Evernote into Eclipse. No need to open Evernote client anymore to add a note, just select something and one-click to save to Evernote elegantly. And you will find you are still in Eclipse.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prairie/Eemory/master/com.prairie.eemory/doc/eclipse-screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n### Feature includes\r\n+ Adding code snippet, source file, screenshot and more to a new note on Evernote.\r\n+ Appending code snippet, source file, screenshot and more to an existing note on Evernote.\r\n+ Adding/Appending multiple files once.\r\n+ Notebook, Note and Tag can be specified(no need to remember their names, we have auto-suggestion) beforehand or in runtime.\r\n+ Also can add a comment for each clip.\r\n+ Syntax highlighting for any language on Evernote just like what you see in Eclipse.\r\n+ Authentication is delegated to Eemory using the OAuth protocol. One-click OAuth authentication as easy to use as a web application did.\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\n#### Eemory 1.0.0-beta (requires JDK 1.6+)\r\nEemory 1.0.0-beta is the latest version and requires a minimum of JDK 1.6.\r\n\r\nView [Readme](https://github.com/prairie/Eemory/blob/master/README.md) and [Wiki](https://github.com/prairie/Eemory/wiki) for limits and more information.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThere are three approaches you can choose:\r\n\r\n+ Install from Eclipse Marketplace in Eclipse(recommended).\r\n+ Install from update site URL: `http://dl.bintray.com/prairie/eemory-update-site`.\r\n+ Install from [archived update site](https://github.com/prairie/Eemory/releases) locally.\r\n\r\nNew to Eclipse plug-in?
